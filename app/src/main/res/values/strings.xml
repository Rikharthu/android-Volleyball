    <string name="doc">At a high level, you use Volley by creating a RequestQueue and passing it
        Request objects. The RequestQueue manages worker threads for running the network operations,
        reading from and writing to the cache, and parsing responses. Requests do the parsing of raw
        responses and Volley takes care of dispatching the parsed response back to the main thread
        for delivery.
